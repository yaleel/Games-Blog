We all share one hobby, which is the love and playing of video games, although from time to time some try to discredit the industry by saying that games have great harm such as inciting violence. Even the World Health Organization has said that it considers gaming addiction a “psychological and mental disorder.”

<p>
On the other hand, we have many and many studies that prove the benefits of games. In 2018, a study was published confirming that playing video games improves your cognitive abilities and increases the gray matter in the brain, and today there is a new study from the University of Vermont in the United States also talking about a great benefit of playing video games.

In a study of 2,217 children who played Video Games between the ages of 9 and 10, it tested those who played at least 21 hours per week, compared to those who did not play at all. The study, whose results were published in the journal "Gamma", showed that children who played electronic games performed better on tests where they had to control behavior or memorize information.

<p>And according to the Axios website, during these tests, researchers noticed that the players' brains showed more activity in areas associated with attention and memory. The researchers did not test whether the type of game children played had an effect on their study results, and encouraged further investigation to see if action games, for example, yield the same results as puzzle games.
