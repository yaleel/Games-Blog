Yesterday, BioWare shared an update regarding Dragon Age Dreadwolf, and it's now playable from start to finish. We also know that the team is working on a new Mass Effect game at the moment, which is in the process of developing non-stop but needs a longer period of time before it is widely revealed.

Gary McKay, BioWare's general manager, said in a statement posted on the team's official blog that the studio has a team "working hard to envision what the future holds for the new Mass Effect focused singles game," and while no further details were provided, the team is looking forward To celebrate N7 next month.

       November 7th, also known as N7 Day, is a day of celebration for the series with the community of players, and saw the release of the official artwork for the upcoming Mass Effect game last year, though we don't know what the team has in store for its fans several weeks from now.

        </p>
<p>It is noteworthy that according to a tweet posted by game producer Brenon Holmes on Twitter last May, the studio is looking for programmers to work on the game, and among the conditions for applicants for this position is that they have experience working with Unreal Engine 4 and Unreal Engine 5. Of course, this is a confirmation of Mass Effect 5 will not be developed using the Frostbite engine, but rather based on Unreal Ening.
