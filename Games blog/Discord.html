In May of last year, a strategic partnership was announced between Sony and Discord to provide the advantages of the popular chatting application to PlayStation owners, and throughout that period, the features of the social chat application were supported in a limited way with promises to provide its full features gradually, and it seems that the wait is about to end for all Playstation angel.

<p>
In February of this year, the ability to link your PlayStation Network account to your Discord account was made available, but reports and leaks were telling us that there was a plan to fully integrate Discord and PlayStation, including voice chats.
</p>         
<p>
        Reporter Tom Henderson published a report explaining that his sources told him that the date of this merger will be on March 8, 2023 with Sony launching the PlayStation 5 update No. 7. He added that the voice chat feature will be the preserve of the owners of the PlayStation 5, while those who own the PlayStation 4 will only be able to view the name of the game they are playing . Discord could also offer a solution to the biggest cross-platform problem, which is voice chatting between competing systems.

<p>A few days ago, 3 new photos were published and leaked for the beginning of the Discord voice chat experiences on the PlayStation 5, and the same source who published those photos returned today and told Henderson when the merger would take place next year.
</p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that last September, Microsoft revealed that the Discord application for Xbox platforms is now available to everyone, as everyone can join the voice chat without the need for the Insiders program.</p>
